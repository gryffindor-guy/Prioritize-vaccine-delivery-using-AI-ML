# Prioritize-vaccine-delivery-using-AI-ML

### Description : 
As the country gears up to unveil, register and approve its choice of vaccine candidates against COVID-19, the first set of population expected to be immunized may be frontline health workers, doctors, people over 50 years of age and people with co-morbidities. The challenge for healthcare administrators would be  prioritizing within this population, considering limited availability of vaccines initially.

An AI-based solution can help identify priority targets groups (e.g. which regions, what demography, which clusters etc.) for various levels of vaccine access. Relevant and publicly available data sources (e.g. population demographics, electoral rolls, health survey information, city/region density, spread, clusterization etc.) can be used to develop prioritization maps, factoring the limited resources (supply of vaccine, healthcare personnel, cold-chain facilities etc.) available to health authorities and showing how it will change as more of this population gets vaccinated over a period of time.

### Solution :

To provide predictive model to find the most affected people who are suffering from to supply vaccine for them first (present people suffering from covid, frontline health workers, doctors, people over 50 years of age and people with co-morbidities) and then for the remaining people based on vaccine delivery


### Solution Approach :
* Datacollections : 
Gather the data based on covid-19 from states and central resources and health survey information in India
* Data Pre-processing :
Which includes Data cleaning, Data reduction and finding incorrect entries(and deleting them).
* Exploratory Data Analysis :
Creating the graphs using the data and understanding them by applying statistical measures.
* predictive model : 
We are going to build a predictive model that recommends certain groups,segments for vaccination.
